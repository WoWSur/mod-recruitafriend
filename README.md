# Recruit A Friend
This is a module for [AzerothCore](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk).

# Features
This module will add two in-game commands.

**.recruit help** will give some basic information on how to use the feature.
**.recruit friend <name>** will add the users account id as a recruiter of the targetted characters account.

All the features are enabled, or disabled, through the configuration - allowing a user to only use the features they want.

There are config options to allow recruiting the same account again after it has expired and to make the recruitment never expire.
