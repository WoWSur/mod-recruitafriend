# Recruit A Friend
This is a module for [AzerothCore](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk).

# Features
This module will add two in-game commands.

**.recruit help** will give some basic information on how to use the feature.
**.recruit friend <name>** will add the users account id as a recruiter of the targetted characters account.

There's a configuration option to determine how long a referral lasts. Setting that value to 0 means it'll never expire.
