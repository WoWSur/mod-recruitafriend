# Refer A Friend
This is a module for [AzerothCore](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk).

# Features
This module adds five new in-game commands.

**.refer help** will give some information on how to use the feature.

There's a configuration option to determine how long a referral lasts. Setting that value to 0 means it'll never expire.

Another configuration option gives players rewards for recruiting other players. The rewards are Swift Zhevra and X-53 Touring Rocket, but can be disabled individually. The reward days option determines how many days has to pass since the referral before the accounts are eligible for rewards. Setting it to 0 disables all rewards.
